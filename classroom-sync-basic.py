# Description: Sync tool for GitHub Classroom assignments
#     This tool will retrieve student repositories and rename them
#        to include their boisestate username instead of their
#        GitHub username.
#
#     Before using this tool, do the following:
#     1. Set up SSH keybased authentication with GitHub
#     2. Download the classroom_roster.csv file from GitHub Classroom
#
#  Usage: classroom-sync.py <assignment> <roster.csv>  <classroom> 
#
#   assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
#   roster.csv - This contains the mapping of GitHub account names to BoiseState account names
#   classroom - Local path where student assignment repositories should be stored
#
