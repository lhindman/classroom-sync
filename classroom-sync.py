# Description: Sync tool for GitHub Classroom assignments
#     This tool will retrieve student repositories and rename them
#        to include Canvas username instead of their
#        GitHub username.
#
#     Before using this tool, do the following:
#       1. Set up SSH keybased authentication with GitHub  
#       2. Download the classroom_roster.csv file from GitHub Classroom  
#       3. Update classroom-config.json with the details for your classroom  
#       4. Enable API access for Canvas user account and store token in OS keyring. Details are provided below
#
#  Usage: classroom-sync.py <assignment> 
#
#   assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
