# Description:  Parse the specified GRADE.md file, sum the total scores from each 
#    section and insert a row containing the total value. Display the total scores
#    to stdout as CSV formatted data.
#
# The following shows the sections that will be processed:
#
# Planning                        /6
# Subject Proficiency             /12
# Coding Conventions              /3
# Terminology Identification      /3
# Code Review                     /2
# Reflection                      /4
# -----------------------------------
# Total                         30/30
#
# The line containing the Total is inserted into the GRADE.md in each student repository for the
#     specified assignment.  Once completed, a CSV file is generated in the current directory
#     that contains a summary of all the student scores for the specified assignments.
#
#  Usage: calculate_totals_and_summaryize.py <assignment> 
#
#   assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
