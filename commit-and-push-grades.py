# Description: This tool will commit and push GRADE.md files located in student
#    repositories to GitHub. It first connects to Canvas to retrieve the student roster,
#    For each student it then opens the local repo in the specified assignment folder
#    and stages (adds) each GRADE.md to a single commit with is then pushed to GitHub.
#
#    While not strictly necessary, by using the Canvas roster this tool can display info
#    regarding students who do not have a local repo or who do not have a GitHub mapping.
#
#    NOTE: This tool is designed to be used on student repositories that have previously been 
#    cloned from GitHub using the classroom-sync.py tool.
#
#  Usage: commit-and-push-grades.py <assignment> 
#
#   assignment - You can find the list of assignment names on GitHub Classroom
